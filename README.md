The Office Trivia
=================

## Why trivia?

I initially tried to make a hangman game. I spent many hours on it, but unfortunately, I was unable to solve one of the last pieces of the puzzle. With time winding down and wanting to meet mvp, I made the decision to try my hand at creating a trivia game. This game is intended for fans of the NBC comedy called "The Office". It will test their knowledge on some common information and some obscure facts only the biggest fans will know.

## Features

* Radio buttons/input were used to provide options for answers for the user. Instead of text, images were incorporated. So, it would be helpful to know who's who on the show. Hence, this game is only for people that have already watched "The Office"

* Once the user clicks the submit button, an encouraging alert is displayed on the screen.

* The game is self-scoring. Once the submit button is clicked at the bottom, the user's score is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

* The user's expertise ranking is also displayed below the score.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## How to play?

Simply click on the circle inside the character who you think is the correct answer for the given question. Once completed, with all of the questions, click submit.
