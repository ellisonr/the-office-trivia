The Office Trivia
=================

## Why trivia?

During the first 2.5-3 days of the allotted 3.5 days to work on Project #1, I was working on a The Office-themed hangman game. I started off strongly with my HTML and CSS and made good progress on the Javascript making the game function how I wanted it to. I was able to turn letters opaque and green or red once they were clicked (green for correct and red for incorrect). However, after several hours of tinkering with and dozens of iterations of the code, I was able to only solve my problem partially.

With time winding down and wanting to meet mvp, I made the decision to try my hand at creating a trivia game. This game is intended for fans of the NBC comedy called "The Office". It will test their knowledge on some common information and some obscure facts only the biggest fans will know. In my opinion, it came together nicely. The formatting and alignment isn't quite responsive, but I'm satisfied with the basic optics and function of the game I've built.

## Features

* Radio buttons/input were used to provide options for answers for the user. Instead of text, images were incorporated. So, it would be helpful to know who's who on the show. Hence, this game is only for people that have already watched "The Office"

* Once the user clicks the submit button, an encouraging alert is displayed on the screen.

* The game is self-scoring. Once the submit button is clicked at the bottom, the user's score is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

* The user's expertise ranking is also displayed below the score.
